# Xvarhet

The ``Xvarhet'' R package contains a collection of quantitative trait variance heterogeneity tests for X-chromosome SNPs.

### Quick Start ###

The current release is: version 1.0 See "release" tab.

To install our R package "Xvarhet", you can either run in R directly:

install.packages("devtools") # if you have not installed already
devtools::install_github("WeiAkaneDeng/Xvarhet")

To load the library in R, simply run in R:

library("Xvarhet")

### New release coming up ###

We are working on an integrated generalized Joint-Location-Scale (gJLS2) R package for genome-wide analysis (both autosomes and X-chromosome). 
Once completed (December 2021 expected), this branch of the Xvarhet will be absorbed under a new project respository and no longer updated.
Stay tuned!
